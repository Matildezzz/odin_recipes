    <h2>Horrible fruit dessert</h2>
    <p>This is an easy grilled peach dessert! I use a honey nut flavored cream cheese spread and it's wonderful! Drizzle a little extra honey after they're grilled and they're perfect!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Peaches</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoon clover honey</li>
        <li>1 Cup soft cream cheese with honey and nuts</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a grill for medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Brush peaches with a light coating of oil. Place pit side down onto the grill. Grill for 5 minutes, or until the surfaces have nice grill marks. Turn the peaches over, and drizzle with a bit of honey. Place a dollop of the cream cheese spread in the place where the pit was. Grill for 2 to 3 more minutes, or until the filling is warm. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
